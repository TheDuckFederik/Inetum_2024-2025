## Obsidian

 This is the QS vault. To use the markdown syntax in obsidian go to the page [[Cheat sheet]], it contains everything about the syntax.

## Presentation

 The first QS task has been a presentation to explain to our boss what is testing. Here is a link to the [[QS Presentation (Rev 1)]] then he gave us the task to make it more technical to present it to the QS Manager of Cat. So we made the [[QS Presentation (Rev 2)]] and adapted and rewrote some paragraphs.

## Formation

To get us on our feet, especially since we don't all go to the same school/classes, they assigned us a few courses over at [[OpenWebinars]],

## [[Theory]]

There are some key concepts in [[QS]]: The two biggest methods that are the different types of tests are divided in [[Manual testing]], [[Automated testing]]. [[Manual testing]] is very straight forward, you open up the piece of software that you have to test (web, app, [[API]], etc.) and you test the features that you have to test by interacting with them, manually. Now, for[[ Automated testing]], here is very different. You have to use a piece of software and create a script that tests the features that the client automatically, and can also be tested with different parameters, or be repeated over and over again. This ends up saving a lot of time when you have to do multiple tests back to back also keeps up consistency in between tests. The main way to automate web tests is [[Selenium]], one of the pillars of testing and one of the most used [[Frameworks]] because it has a big range of tools, and it's compatible with [[Java]], [[JavaScript]] and [[Python]]. But to tell the script the item that it has to interact with and where it is, we use [[XPath]], a markup language that gets use because it's a more compact version of [[XML]]. Now as said before the most used [[Programming languages]] are: [[Java]], [[JavaScript]] and [[Python]] mostly because of their wide use in the industry. In testing the 3 most used [[IDE]] are: [[VSCode]], [[Eclipse]] and [[Android studio]], all have their pros and cons, but they are used because of their versatility, security, and visualization (in respective order).
